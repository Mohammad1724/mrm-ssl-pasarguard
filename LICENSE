Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

2. Source Code.
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.

3. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a work except as expressly provided
under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

4. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program. 

5. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
